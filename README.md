# XDR and SIEM Solution with Wazuh - Proof of Concept

## Overview
This repository contains a Proof of Concept (PoC) for integrating Wazuh as an XDR and SIEM solution within a Kubernetes environment. The PoC is designed to be deployed locally using Minikube and includes vulnerable endpoints to demonstrate the capabilities of Wazuh in monitoring and detecting security events.

## Components

### Wazuh Manager
The Wazuh Manager is responsible for collecting and analyzing data from the agents. It is deployed as a Kubernetes pod and is the core of the SIEM system.

### Wazuh Indexer
The Wazuh Indexer stores and indexes logs and alerts generated by the Wazuh agents. It replaces the need for an external Elasticsearch deployment.

### Wazuh Dashboard
The Wazuh Dashboard provides a user interface to visualize and analyze the data stored in the Wazuh Indexer. It replaces the need for an external Kibana deployment.
